    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>The air warm, yet crisp. Thunder rolling in the distant skies.<br> 
    A young boy holding an oil lamp walks into a secluded town.<br>His loyal dog Tony walking cautiously by his side.<br> 
    They approach a dark and worn down house with boarded up windows. Thunder roars in the distance and rain falls. 
    Tony the dog keeps up his guard.<br></p>
