      <h1 class="burn">The Burning Moon</h1>

      <p>It was a dark and stormy night...<br>The air warm, yet crisp. Thunder rolling in the distant skies.<br> 
      A young boy holding an oil lamp walks into a secluded town.<br>His loyal dog Tony walking cautiously by his side.<br> 
      They approach a dark and worn down house with boarded up windows. Thunder roars in the distance and rain falls. 
      Tony the dog keeps up his guard.<br>Though they are both getting soaked, they walk, not run, around the side through the 
      black iron bar gate.<br></p>
